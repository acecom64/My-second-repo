    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">Today there are a lot of websites that are not secure. The reason for this is partially in the improper spellings found in the URL. What and why is this?</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">One of the many mistakes people might do when constructing a website lays in the “http/https” part. These two are quite different since one has an encryption on all data and communication that are being transferred from a browser to the website’s server. The other simply doesn’t. The one with this option is “https”, which the “s” stands for secure. It also indicates that the site is using “Secure Sockets Layer Certificate” (or simply SSL).
        In other words; if you want your data secure when using websites, remember to take a second look at the “http/https” part. It might do you a huge favour when transmitting sensitive/personal data.
